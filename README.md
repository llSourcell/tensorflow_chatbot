# Tensorflow Chatbot
Tensorflow Chatbot Demo by @Sirajology on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/SJDEOWLHYVo)

Note from HazeHub :
====
21/01/16 : The few days have taken longer than expected. Still haven't had the time to work on a proper modification so I decided to add my personal version of the tensorflow chatbot with all the generated files from Cornell's Corpus. Just extract the zip file, train the bot and you should be allright !

old : This fork hasn't been updated for the moment. I have all the correct code to make it work with Python 3.5 and tensorflow 0.12 on my local storage. Give me a few days and this should be updated.



Overview
============
This is the full code for 'How to Make an Amazing Tensorflow Chatbot Easily' by @Sirajology on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/SJDEOWLHYVo). In this demo code, we implement Tensorflows [Sequence to Sequence](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html) model to train a
chatbot on the [Cornell Movie Dialogue dataset](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). After training for a few hours, the bot is able to hold a fun conversation.


Dependencies
============
* numpy
* scipy 
* six
* tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html)

Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies


Usage
===========

To train the bot, edit the `seq2seq.ini` file so that mode is set to train like so

`mode = train`

then run the code like so

``python execute.py``

To test the bot during or after training, edit the `seq2seq.ini` file so that mode is set to test like so

`mode = test`

then run the code like so

``python execute.py``


Challenge
===========

The challenge for this video is write an entirely different script using [TF Learn](http://tflearn.org/) to generate Lord of the Ring style sentences. Check out this very similar [example](https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn/blob/master/examples/nlp/lstm_generator_shakespeare.py), it uses TF Learn to generate Shakespeare-style sentences. Train your model on Lord of the rings text to do something similar! And play around with the hyperparameters to get a more accurate result. Post your GitHub link in the video comments and I'll judge it!
